# Round 001

## Day 001 - 20210201
### Progress
- start with FCC's curriculum : continue JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification
- got 3 questions about recursion : loop to recursion, countdown array, range of numbers
### Thoughts
- glad and excited to get up and running on this challenge
- it is time to achieve the other certifications
- need to grasp more understanding about how recursion works
### Link
- got one achievement before in [Responsive Web Design](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/hizkiajuan/responsive-web-design) certification

## Day 002 - 20210202
### Progress
- finish FCC's ES6 curriculum : module import/export, promise
- dig deeper about Promise on [javascript.info](https://javascript.info/async)
- javascript.info (2/8 topics) : learn about "callback-based" async, Promise intro
### Thoughts
- syntax `import { something } from 'somewhere.js'` similar to object destructuring `const { something } = somewhere.js`
- a `new Promise()` syntax indicates a "constructor function"
- Promise-thing : resolve, reject, then, catch, finally
- `finally` will pass through any result (or error) to its next handler
- only the first resolve/reject call that is taken into account
